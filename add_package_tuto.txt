1. In control file, have :
	Version: 1.0

2. In Makefile have :
	PACKAGE_VERSION = $(THEOS_PACKAGE_BASE_VERSION)

3. Build tweak

4. On Repo, add .deb to the "debs" folder

5. In the "Packages" file, add an empty space after another tweak 
	(everything for the same tweak must not have extra spaces).

	Use the same stuff that is in the control file (the one before build).
	BUT you must also add extra options if some were generated in the .deb :
		Installed-Size: 104
	Might need to extract the .deb from Filza to see the generated control 
	file because it doesnt always show on windows.
	Then after everything is there, you need to add these :
		Filename: /debs/com.yourcompany.xelahottest_1.0_iphoneos-arm.deb
		Size: 6694
		MD5sum: 36f379295c15ef879664fca7192c8e94

6. Compress the "Packages" file to a bzip2 archive
